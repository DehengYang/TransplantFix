Q: Where is the code for graph differencing?

A: The relevant code is available at: [https://github.com/DehengYang/TransplantFix/tree/master/apr_tools/Transplantfix/transplantfix/src/main/java/apr/aprlab/repair/adapt/ged](https://github.com/DehengYang/TransplantFix/tree/master/apr_tools/Transplantfix/transplantfix/src/main/java/apr/aprlab/repair/adapt/ged). We used a graph differencing algorithm proposed by Abu et al. [1] and our code implementation was built on top of the corresponding open-source project (see [https://github.com/zeinaabuaisheh/Anytime_Graph_Edit_Distance](https://github.com/zeinaabuaisheh/Anytime_Graph_Edit_Distance)).
