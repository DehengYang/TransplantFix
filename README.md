## TODO List

+ Integration into [Repairnator](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator)
  (https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/issues/1257)
+ Improve Transplantfix to better assist in real-world manual debugging.

## 1. TransplantFix Framework

The framework of TransplantFix is presented as follows:

![TransplantFix_architecture](./doc/figs/framework.png)

**We aim to contribute a novel APR technique that leverages graph differencing-based code transplantation to the APR community. We release the complete source code TransplantFix that covers the whole automated program repair pipeline, including [fault localization](./fl_modules/fault_localizer), [patch generation](./apr_tools/Transplantfix), [patch validation](./patch_validator/patch_validator). We hope the publicly available implementation could facilitate follow-up research towards conquering more complicated/new real-world bugs.** 

## 2. Reproduction

### 2.1. Environment

The implementation and evaluation of TransplantFix are performed with:

- OS: Ubuntu 16.04
- JDK: JDK 7 (for Defects4J v1.2) and JDK 8 (for Defects4J v2.0)
- Python 3 (with Conda environment)
- Maven 3
  
### 2.2. Configuration

1) To configure Defects4J v1.2:

```shell
cd datasets/
git clone https://github.com/rjust/defects4j.git defects4j
cd defects4j
git checkout v1.4.0
./init.sh
```

2) To configure Defects4J v2.0:

```shell
cd datasets/
git clone https://github.com/rjust/defects4j.git defects4j2
cd defects4j2
git checkout v2.0.0
./init.sh
```

### 2.3. Packaging

To package projects of fault localization, patch generation (i.e., the core module of TransplantFix), and patch validation:

```shell
cd apr_tools/Transplantfix && ./package.sh
cd fl_modules/fault_localizer/package.sh && ./package.sh
cd patch_validator/patch_validator/package.sh && ./package.sh
```

### 2.4. Execution

To run TransplantFix on Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0:

```shell
cd Runner
export PYTHONPATH=./dataset:./apr:./localization:${PYTHONPATH} 
python ./Run_bugs_d4jv1.py

python ./Run_bugs_d4jv2.py
```
